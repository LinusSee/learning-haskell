# advanced
Following the advanced tutorials on [mmhaskell](mmhaskell.com) starting [here](https://mmhaskell.com/real-world/databases)
Since I had some problems with postgesql, I restarted the project in another [folder](https://github.com/LinusSee/learning-haskell/tree/master/mmhaskell/example), so check it out
if you want to see the full version (still mostly following the tutorial though).
